# NOSBENCH
`NOSBENCH` is a benchmark suite of mathematical programs with complementarity constraiants (MPCCs):
```
minimize f(w,p), subject to
lbw <= w <= ubw
lbg <= g(w,p) <= ubg
0 <= G(w,p) perp H(w,p) >= 0
```
We provide the problems in two forms: casADi expressions stored in json encoded structures and matlab `.mat` files which can be used with `v0.5.0` of [`nosnoc`](https://github.com/nurkanovic/nosnoc).

The json structures contains the fields: `w`, `lbw`, `ubw`, `w0`, `p`, `p0`, `g_fun(w,p)` (general nonlinear constriants `g`), `lbg`, `ubg`, `G_fun(w,p)`, `H_fun(w,p)` (Complementarity varibles), `augmented_objective_fun(w,p)` (objective `f(w,p)`).
